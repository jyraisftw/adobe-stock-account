 # Adobe Stock Account – How to Get Started and Key Benefits
Creating an Adobe Stock account is easy and offers many benefits for creatives who frequently use Adobe’s ecosystem. With an Adobe Stock account, users can save and organize collections, purchase assets, and manage licenses in one place. Users can integrate their Adobe Stock account with Adobe Creative Cloud, allowing them to import stock assets directly into programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. Adobe also offers a 30-day trial, giving new users a chance to explore the platform with 10 free assets. For professionals working across multiple Adobe applications, an Adobe Stock account offers convenient access and streamlined asset management.
